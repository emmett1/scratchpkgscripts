Enable the following options in the kernel configuration and recompile the kernel if
necessary:

	File systems  --->
	  <*/M> FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) support [CONFIG_FUSE_FS]

Using Ntfs-3g:

To mount a Windows partition at boot time, put a line like this in /etc/fstab:

/dev/sda1 /mnt/windows auto defaults 0 0
To allow users to mount a usb stick with an NTFS filesystem on it, put a line
similar to this (change sdc1 to whatever a usb stick would be on your system) in
/etc/fstab:

/dev/sdc1 /mnt/usb auto user,noauto,umask=0,utf8 0 0
In order for a user to be able to mount the usb stick, they will need to be able
to write to /mnt/usb, so as the root user:

chmod -v 777 /mnt/usb
